For this challenge, modify each of the following design patterns:
- mostly fluid
- column drop
- layout shifter
- tiny tweaks
- off canvas

For each design pattern, create a directory with three folders:
- 01_before
- 02_meta-viewport
- 03_disable-font-boosting

In the "before" folder add text to each div which is not a container for other div, paragraph, span, or anchor elements.

In the "meta-viewport" folder, include the meta viewport tag. Now look to see how the meta-viewport tag changed the way the page is displayed on mobile.

In the "no-font-boosting" folder, add the necessary declarations in the css to disable font-boosting. Now look to see how disabling font-boosting changed the way the page is displayed on mobile.
