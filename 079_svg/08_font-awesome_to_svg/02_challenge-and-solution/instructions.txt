choose an icon from font-awesome

extract that icon to an SVG file

clean-up the SVG file

display the SVG file in a webpage

display a second version of the SVG in the file and give it an id

use CSS to target the SVG with the id and change its color: experiment with using the SVG attributes "fill" and "stroke"

add css to change the "fill" color of the svg when the mouse hovers over the svg

*** REMEMBER ***
Remember to link your stylesheet to your html document
