*understand fonts
see "fyi_about-fonts" in this folder

*install font awesome OTF (or WOFF) font on your computer

on mac:
double click the OTF font
choose "install"

google how to do this on other platforms if you're not sure:
install font windows
install font linux

*understand raster (bitmap) vs. vector images
A vector SVG file is just an XML file

*open adobe illustrator
or other vector graphic software

*copy image from font awesome cheat sheet
or other page
https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet/

*in illustrator, select text tool, click on screen, paste

*highlight the thing you pasted

*change the font
font-awesome

*shrink the illustrator "artboard"
object / artboards / "fit artwork to bounds"

*save the svg

File > Export
you’ll se that you can output PNG, Flash, AutoCAD, TIFF, and Photoshop files, but not SVG files.

File > Save for Web
you’ll notice that you can output PNG, GIF or JPEG files. No trace of SVG.

File > Save As
exports SVG files from Illustrator

 “Use Artboards”
 option in the Save As dialog box.
 If you have designed 10 symbols in your Illustrator file, you can use this option to easily create one artboard per symbol, and output 10 SVG files (one per symbol) in a single operation

SVG 1.1
the version recommended by the W3C.
SVG Tiny was created a long time ago to support the first generation of mobile devices such as Blackberry phones andPDAs. Today, it doesn’t make sense to export SVG Tiny files if you target smartphones.

FONT
SVG / only glyphs used
Web designers must select the type “SVG”, to enable the font format defined by the W3C.
With SVG, you can save a subset of glyphs within the document. This will, of course, increase the size of your SVG file, but it’s a nice way to embed a font. If you don’t plan to dynamically change the text content of your SVG, you can select “ONLY GLYPHS USED”. Illustrator will detect and embed the characters used in your document.

The third option, “CONVERT TO OUTLINE”, can be useful if you don’t want to automatically convert your text content into SVG paths. This can be used for an icon with a few characters such as “Home”, or “Info”.
The file size difference between a subset of glyphs and converted fonts to SVG paths is not significant.
However, if you use complex fonts (such as handwriting fonts), it will dramatically increase the size of your SVG file. Also, if you scale down too much a font converted to outlined paths, you may lose some visual fidelity (but that’s just in theory, I cannot detect a clear difference in modern browsers).
