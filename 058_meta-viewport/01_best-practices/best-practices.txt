With responsive web pages, use the meta viewport tag to control the width and scaling of the browser's viewport.

Include width=device-width to match the screen's width in device-independent pixels.

Include initial-scale=1 to establish a 1:1 relationship between CSS pixels and device-independent pixels.

Ensure your page is accessible by not disabling user scaling.
